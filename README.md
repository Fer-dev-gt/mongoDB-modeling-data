# mongoDB-modeling-data
On this repo I applied data modeling for Document based DataBases like MongoDB, from schema validation to use of aggregation framework to display referenced data from two collections, also I wrote queries to use all kind of relationships between documents like 1 to 1 embedded and referenced, 1 to N embedded and referenced and N to N only referenced.

You'll be able to find each topic of interest about data modeling inside one of the many labeled folders with diferente topics like use of Regular Expressions (RegEx) to use of Computer Pattern to save processing power on doing queries on the reading side and place them only on the writing side so the DataBase can be more efficient.

Any comment or contribution is greatly supported, thank you for coming by. Enjoy! 🤓💻
